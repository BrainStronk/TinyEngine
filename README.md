# TinyEngine
A tiny engine written in C.

TinyEngine is a very small engine written in C. TinyEngine is written with care, every line of code that goes into master is reviewed and tested. No third party dependencies are even added if they do make sense. TinyEngine does not aim to solve the problems of modern engines, but rather serve as a good example for how quality software should be written.
